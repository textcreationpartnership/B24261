            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">FOr the Cure of the <hi>Scurvy, Dropsy, Jaundise, Leprosy, Kings-evil, Green Sickness,</hi> or any other Chronick Distemper whatsoever, which my printed Books which are given out with each Box of Pils will inform you of the Names, and Places of Abode of several Persons that have been cured by them.</head>
            <byline>Prepared and Set forth by <hi>John Holney,</hi> Student in Physick, and Apothecary at <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> with a Description of the Scurvy.</byline>
            <p>God's great Blessing to Mankind in this Life, is Health and long Life; the former of which if wanting makes the latter miserable. And amidst all Diseases that afflict Mans body, there is none so Epidemical and Raging at this time as the <hi>Scurvy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scurvy</hi> is a certain evil habit of the whole Body, turning all the Aliment we receive into evil Humours, taking its Original from Crude and Melancholy Humours; the Cause whereof is for want of good Digestion in the Stomack, caused either by great Obstructions of the Spleen, Liver, or Mesentery, and sometime from Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sweetbreds, as also from a raw and undigested Blood in the whole Body, but chiefly in the Hypochondries or Sides, which offends by a certain specifick Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction arising from our Diet, as salt and windy Meats, and many other things not natural to our Bodies; to which may be added the great Excess of Tobacco that is generally taken. The Signs of the Scurvy are these; A Weariness without cause; a sluggish Dulness about the lower Parts of your Body, as if you felt some great weight; a Weakness of the Thighs, a Straitness of the Breast, and Difficulty of Breathing; also the Strength much impaired; a Redness and Itching in the Gums; the Face grows pale; the Pulse small and unequal; the Teeth grow loose and often ake; besides there is a Corruption of the Gums, and a great Stinking of the Breath; the Thighs and Legs are full of purple spots, also sometimes red and livid, or inclining to blackness, at other times yellow, according to the Constitution and evil State of the Body. There is also a great Weakness in the Joynts, Pains in the Shoulders, Sides, Hipps, Thighs, Knees, and Legs; moreover there is many times great Pain in the Head, Stomack, and Back. This Disease many times (<hi>Proteus</hi> like) shews it self in several Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as <hi>Eugalenus</hi> formerly, and since our learned Country-Man Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> hath taken particular notice of; as the <hi>Palsy, Chollick Pains Convulsions, Gouts, Fluxes of the Belly,</hi> and many times very <hi>costive Swounings, Plurisies, Apoplexies, Falling-Sickness, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, sottish Sleepiness,</hi> and <hi>Feavers</hi> of all kinds. This Disease, if not cured in time, grows very dangerous, many dying suddenly thereof, some break out into evil Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, others fall blind, some fall into Consumptions, others into Dropsies.</p>
            <p>These Pills cure all Diseases incident to the Brain, if taken in time, as <hi>Vertigo, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy, Lethargy, Headach, Falling-Sickness, Palsy, Madness, Frenzy, Diziness;</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they cure Ulcers in any part of the Body, although in the Legs. I have cured several of long standing, and all other Distempers that are possible to be cured by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which my printed Books that are given out with each Box of Pills will further inform you. I shall now only inform you of three or four very strange Cures that have been performed by my Pills since the printing of my Books, wherein you may find betwixt thirty or forty more, which may satisfie any indifferent Person of the Goodness of these Pills; my purpose being only at present by giving these Papers about to make them more fully known: for several Persons that have taken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:195894:2"/>them in <hi>London</hi> have been cured of several Distempers in a very short space, and with small charge, when all other Medicines could effect no Cure upon them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Patrick,</hi> Butcher in little <hi>East-Cheap,</hi> can acquaint you of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Name and Place of Abode, that was very much troubled with the <hi>Kings-evil,</hi> and was twice touched by his Majesty, and afterwards used several other Remedies though to no purpose, was notwithstanding cured in a very short space by the use of these Pills.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ann,</hi> the Wife of <hi>John Gratwick</hi> of <hi>Shermanbury,</hi> Esq; being very much troubled with the yellow Jaundise, her Face and whole Body being very yellow, or rather of a saffron colour, her appetite lost, and she worn away to skin and bones; after seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Remedies used by a very able Doctor for her Cure (although to no purpose) was throughly cured by the use of these Pills.</p>
            <p>The Widow <hi>Fenn,</hi> alias <hi>Fenner,</hi> living in <hi>Hayton-Street</hi> in the Parish of <hi>West-Furle</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> being troubled with a <hi>Dropsy</hi> for a long time, so that her Belly and Legs were mightily swelled, the small of her Legs being as big as the Thighs of most Men, and withal very Astmatical, so that she could hardly breath, having made use of several Physicians for her Cure, but all unsuccessful, was at last perswaded to make use of my Pills; and by the use of 7 or 8 <hi>s.</hi> worth of them was throughly cured. Attested by the Minister of the <hi>Parish</hi> with several other Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Harwood</hi> of <hi>Alciston</hi> being very much troubled with the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> having a great pain in his Head and Stomack, no Appetite to his Victuals; he was troubled likewise with a great pain all over his Limbs, as also a great <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> or Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Eyes; was cured of all these Distempers in a very short space by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one whole Box of these <hi>Pills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might mention many other Cures which I shall forbear, having referred the Reader to the printed Books.</p>
            <p>Lastly, these <hi>Pills</hi> will leave no Man unsatisfied that makes use of tthem, for they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen all Obstructions whatsoever, and purifie the whole Mass of Blood and Nervous Juice from all Heterogenous Admixture whatsoever. They exactly cure the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> and do free the Body from all Impurities.</p>
            <p>The Method and Order of taking these <hi>Pills</hi> is fully described in my printed Books, which are given with each Box of Pills. The biggest Box, containing 60 <hi>Pills,</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> the half Box, containing 30 <hi>Pills,</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and the small Box, containing 12 <hi>Pills,</hi> for four Doses, 1 s.</p>
